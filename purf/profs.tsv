Figuring out what the "bad guys" are doing with your data: If someone really wanted to find out personal things about you online, how far could they get? Let's investigate this by writing a bot which, given an identity (say, an email address), collects and aggregates information from various sites about that person. Ideally, it should be able to automatically figure out which information is current and which is out of date, reconcile conflicts, make new inferences based on multiple pieces of data, and hook into the "deep web" — pages that are not directly visible on web searches.; 2. Reverse engineering the Web to expose poor security and privacy: Web companies track us online and compile extensive databases of our personal information. The personal behavioral profiles created through tracking are used for targeted advertising, price discrimination, targeted political emails, and various other practices that make people uncomfortable. I have an ongoing project to automatically reverse engineer cookies stored in browsers (which may be encoded or encrypted) to figure out what information companies have collected about you and what they are using it for. We are just getting started, and there are many interesting sub-projects to work on.; 3. Use machine learning to improve privacy: "Google Now" serendipitously shows you information you might find useful, such as driving time to your home when you're away. Can we serendipitously show people information to improve privacy? For example, when you're out on Halloween night with your friends, your phone could automatically figure out that one of them has a habit of always posting pictures publicly on Facebook, and notify you of this, so that you could request that they not take pictures of you.;4. Classify and rank research blogs, set up aggregators: I run the Theory of Computing blog aggregator which is read by a significant fraction of the theory research community. It's a very efficient way to stay on top of the research conversation. I'd like to set one up on every research subtopic (and there are hundreds), but it is time-consuming. But this can be automated! Here's how: 1. collect URLs of research blogs by programmatically exploring the web 2. use machine learning to group them into topics, and rank them by authority within topics 3. set up aggregators on each topic. This is a challenging project involving machine learning, large datasets and web programming, but potentially highly impactful.	http://randomwalker.info/publications/author-identification-draft.pdf;http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak09.pdf	http://randomwalker.info/	I'm a Computer Science/CITP Assistant Professor at Princeton and an affiliate scholar at Stanford Law School's CIS.

Information-based complexity refers to the complexity of continuous mathematical problems, such as integration or approximation of continuous functions. The most interesting cases are problems which refer to multivariate functions, where the number of variables (dimension of the problem) is considered "huge". I am interested in studying ways to eliminate the "curse of dimensionality", namely the exponential dependence of the cost of algorithms on the dimension. Prerequisites: Reasonable mathematical maturity. In case of a project related to Quantum Computation a certain familiarity with quantum mechanics is required (related courses: ELE 396/PHY 208).	TRUE

In the next decades, large-scale explorations of complex molecular, cellular, and organismic systems at complementary levels of resolution will allow us to integrate our understanding of macroscopic physiology and microscopic biology. To realize the full potential of these developments, we need to develop sophisticated bioinformatics frameworks to integrate and synthesize diverse biological data produced by these methods.  The goal of my research is to bring the capabilities of computer science and statistics to the study of gene function and regulation in the biological networks through integrated analysis of biological data from diverse data sources--both existing and yet to come (e.g. from diverse gene expression data sets and proteomic studies).

In addition to moving information around in the classical sense, some alternative questions arise when you consider using information to coordinate actions in a control setting. The mathematical tools needed to characterize the limits of compression in these settings are related to rate-distortion theory and require additional novel concepts as well. My primary research directions are: - Information theoretic security - Multiuser information theory - Communication for control Secondary interests: - Knowledge from the masses (i.e., Wikipedia) - Investment (portfolio) theory - Machine learning - Statistical physics, random algorithms, belief propagation - Audio processing I received my Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Brigham Young University and earned both a Master's and Ph.D. from Stanford University. After taste-testing the broad field of electrical engineering, my curiosity finally led me to research information theory with Thomas Cover, my dissertation advisor. I received honors as a graduate student for my performance on the qualifying exam and for my efforts as a teaching assistant. In 2008, at the International Symposium on Information Theory, I received a student paper award for my unorthodox, independently authored work on communication requirements for generating correlated random variables.

The emphasis is on propagation problems that are universal to wave systems, taking advantage of the fact that optical systems allow easy control of the input and direct imaging of the output. Using a healthy mix of theory and experiment, my group studies both basic nonlinear physics and advanced design issues for photonic applications. As a prime example, my group is developing optical hydrodynamics, in which the nonlinear propagation of light is described in terms of the equations for ideal fluid flow. For coherent (laser) light, the intensity acts as a fluid density while the direction of the wavefront gives an effective velocity. For incoherent light, the propagation can be treated as a statistical fluid, i.e. a plasma. Using these mappings, we have experimentally demonstrated optical shock waves, instabilities, turbulence, and thermodynamics. There are two primary results of these mappings: (1) optical modeling and observation of fluid behavior that is difficult, if not impossible, to see by other means and (2) a framework for the discovery of new optical physics. If the optical waves carry information, then propagation can be leveraged for dynamical signal processing. For example, nonlinear wave mixing can result in (intensity-dependent) energy transfer between modes, enabling higher resolution, increase field of view, and improved signal-noise properties. Recently, we have generalized computational imaging to include spatial nonlinearity and are applying it to microscopy, phase retrieval, and imaging through scattering media. Particular areas of interest include digital holography, noisy imaging, and biomedical optics.  	TRUE

Our special focus is currently on Quantum Cascade (QC) lasers, a novel type of semiconductor injection laser based on electronic intersubband transitions in the conduction band of a coupled quantum well heterostructure. Quantum wells are slivers of one type of semiconductor material, just a few atomic layers thick, interleaved with another type of semiconductor (the barriers). Many performance features of the lasers, such as their power, modulation capabilities, or emission wavelength in the mid- to far-infrared, are designed into the device by choice of the thicknesses of the quantum wells and barriers. With some 500 to 1000 quantum wells and barriers in a single laser, there are endless opportunities for creativity! Our current projects include the development of high-temperature, high-power, high-efficiency QC lasers. Widely tunable, monolithic, and external cavity QC lasers are being developed for optical sensors in environmental, medical, and security applications. While my group is focused mainly on the development of the lasers, we maintain strong collaborations with many expert spectroscopists who are building sensor systems in academia, government, and industrial labs. My group's working style is collaborative and open. Group members expect to work hard and to have a lot of fun, too! Device modeling on the computer, device fabrication in the PRISM cleanroom facilities, and optical device characterization in our labs each take up about 30 percent of the work week.

At first, materials and devices were introduced that were designed with quantum mechanical principles, but still operated on classical information (for example, the silicon transistor). More recently, devices have been developed to store and manipulate quantum bits of information (qubits) towards quantum computing applications. Until the past few years, however, these qubits have only been addressed with classical light signals. A fully quantum mechanical circuit, in which quantum mechanical microwave signals address quantum bits, enables scalable quantum computing architectures and makes possible a full range of quantum optics experiments, all on a single chip in an integrated circuit. Our research focuses on these fully quantum mechanical integrated circuits, combining basic quantum mechanics, superconducting electronics, microwave circuits, quantum optics, and low-temperature measurement. The backbone of our work is a system known as circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). This system consists of a superconducting qubit coupled to an on-chip microwave resonator; the qubit can absorb and re-emit a single photon into the cavity hundreds of times before the photon is lost. This strong coupling opens the door to a vast array of experiments in quantum computing and non-linear optics. These are the two main thrusts of my research. First, my group is looking at ways of building a robust scalable quantum architecture. While small qubit systems have been developed and microwave cavities have been shown to make a good quantum bus connecting these qubits, large-scale quantum computers remain a distant goal. Quantum information is quite fragile, and individual qubits are currently plagued by information loss, called decoherence. Are there ways of building individual qubits that are robust to dominant noise sources? Even if perfect qubits could be achieved, new problems arise as circuits get more and more complicated. How can we wire up complex systems without destroying the individual parts? These are the types of quantum computing questions we address experimentally. My second main research area is the study of quantum and non-linear optics. Although people tend to think of lasers when they hear the term “optics,” the oscillating voltages and currents in a microwave circuit are also photons, and all principles of quantum optics apply to these devices as well. In fact, non-linearities can be much stronger in microwave devices, allowing us access to a very interesting regime of quantum optics. The goal of this area of research is to address the central question: What happens when a system is non-linear at powers where quantization is important?  	TRUE

FinFETs come in many styles: shorted-gate, independent-gate, asymmetric, and thus offer a much richer design space than bulk CMOS. There are many projects that are likely to lead to novel FinFET circuits and architectures. These span various levels of the design hierarchy: device, standard cells, optimization under process variations, SRAMs, microarchitecture, cache, network-on-chip, chip multiprocessor.;Security of Internet of Things (IoT): By 2020, it is expected that 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet. That is very exciting. However, it also implies that billions of devices can be hacked remotely. Hacking of medical devices and automobiles has attracted recent attention. However, the problem is much larger. The question is how do we maintain privacy, confidentiality, integrity and availability in the IoT era.;Energy-efficient buildings: 40% of US energy is consumed in commercial and residential buildings.

The scaling of bulk CMOS, however, faces significant challenges in the future due to fundamental material and process technology limits. The primary obstacles to the scaling of bulk CMOS to the 22nm technology node include short-channel effects, sub-threshold leakage, and device-to-device variations. It is expected that the use of double-gate field-effect transistors (DG-FETs), the most popular of which are FinFETs, will be necessary to overcome these obstacles to scaling. My group is actively investigating novel FinFET-based circuits, memories, and computer architectures. 3D ICs are emerging as solutions to the problems of long interconnect and memory bandwidth. In addition, such ICs enable “More than Moore's Law” applications that allow heterogeneous integration across their multiple layers, opening up exciting possibilities for innovative SoC design. We are investigating various 3D ICs that employ novel system designs comprising embedded processors, RF circuitry, FPGAs, and memories. Power consumption has become one of the most important metrics in evaluating a circuit today. This is due both to environmental considerations and to a variety of technical requirements such as prolonging battery life in portable devices, reducing chip packaging and cooling costs, and increasing reliability. To that end, my group has been researching low-power FPGAs, interconnection networks, and CMPs. We are also interested in the related important problem of dynamic thermal management. Security is emerging as an important concern in the embedded system area. Security of embedded systems is often compromised due to vulnerabilities in the “trusted” software they execute. Security attacks exploit these vulnerabilities. My group has been working on a hardware-assisted paradigm as well as virtualization to enhance embedded system security by detecting and preventing the execution of malware. If not enough care is taken when testing an IC, even a good die may be inadvertently damaged by the high temperatures caused by test application. Although low-power test has a rich history, temperature-aware test is a new field. We are currently developing various temperature-aware test methodologies. The quest for quantum computers is gathering steam. Various quantum algorithms have been developed that show speeds orders of magnitude above those of classical computing. My group is interested in automatically obtaining optimized quantum logic circuits from these quantum algorithms. Energy consumption has also become an important issue, especially from the point of view of carbon dioxide emissions. In the U.S., buildings consume 40% of the total energy. Thus, reducing the energy consumed in buildings can have a substantial national impact. My group is developing various types of sensors to reduce the electricity/heating costs in buildings.

It is critical to consider, for instance, how to deploy in concert an ever-increasing number of transistors with acceptable power consumption, and how to make hardware user-friendly yet effective for applications. Over the past 30 years, my research group has studied the development of signal processing systems. Our research findings have played direct and indirect roles in the construction of a number of useful signal processing systems. In this dynamic discipline, however, emerging applications always dictate new system metrics on power consumption, speed, and performance. This inspires novel intellectual challenges on system designs. Two vital applications that have emerged in recent years are multimedia and genomics. They form an important basis of a new paradigm of information processing that relies heavily on intelligent search/processing.  Multimedia technologies will profoundly change the way we access information. They will also provide new challenges for machine learning research. We investigate various issues relevant to intelligent multimedia communication application, and develop machine learning tools for various adaptive and content-based technologies for MPEG-4 applications such as compression, indexing, and retrieval of visual information. This work has natural and promising extensions to internet search engines, document analysis, and biometric authentication.  The field of bioinformatics represents a natural convergence of life sciences and information technologies. Modern large-scale DNA devices such as microarrays have rapidly and steadily generated enormous amounts of genomic data. We study advanced machine learning tools that could reveal salient information embedded in genomic data and facilitate classification and prediction of tumors and their responses to drug therapies.  From the application perspective, machine learning is both effective and instrumental for distilling useful information embedded in the wealth of the available data. We study tailor-designed machine learning tools for specific applications including feature extraction, clustering, and classification. Machine learning tools can also be adopted to facilitate integration of data collected from experiments in different levels of biological systems or fusion of diversified multimedia data such as text, speech, image, video, and graphics.  In addition to application studies, we also investigate theoretical aspects of machine learning, based on the basic principle of learning by example. These theoretical foundations include statistical learning, optimization, and algebraic theory. In the past half century, machine learning techniques have evolved from simple linear classifiers to neural networks and, recently, to kernel-based approaches. The promise of the kernel approach hinges upon its new representation vector space, leading to a divergent data structure. It also theoretically assures the linear separability of training data in the reproducible kernel space. Moreover, it provides a unified treatment of heterogeneous genomic data, including vectors, sequences, and graphs.  We investigate both categories of kernel-based learning techniques:  1. Unsupervised learning for cluster discovery and graph partition. Kernel approaches extend the conventional K-means (designed for clustering vectors in Euclidean space) to any objects that can be characterized by pairwise relationship (sequences or graphs). The result may be applied to kernel-based (e.g., kernel K-means), and graph-based clustering algorithms. The latter have potential applications to genomics (e.g., interaction networks, metabolic networks, or signaling pathways) and multimedia (e.g., search engines and World Wide Web/social networks).  2. Supervised cluster discovery and supervised classification/prediction. Kernel approaches provide a unified framework between Fisher and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. This ultimately leads to a unifying hybrid classifier, which includes Fisher’s discriminant analysis (FDA) and SVM as special cases. The unified classifier offers necessary flexibility for improving prediction performance.	TRUE

Lots of times we need to take a bunch of data or upload complicated instructions to instruments.

The complexity of chips has been doubling every eighteen months, and their speed has been increasing by a factor of ten every five years. A key ingredient in this progress has been a deeper understanding of the physics of the materials and devices. The goal of my research is to advance the physical foundations of devices and develop new kinds of devices. As devices have been made smaller, quantum effects have become important. These effects already influence the operation of commercial devices. We are investigating new device designs, which will take advantage of quantum mechanical processes to provide a route to further device scaling and performance improvements. For example, “quantum dots” – a few hundred or thousand molecules of one material embedded in another – exhibit a range of useful properties for new types of semiconductor emitters and detectors. An important component of our research is directed towards developing fully quantum-coherent devices as needed for quantum information processing. While quantum computation theoretically provides revolutionary advances, the physical realization will be exceptionally challenging. Our major emphasis has been on demonstrating ways to use the spin of an electron as a quantum bit (qubit). For example, we have found that the quantum coherence of electron’s spins in a silicon crystal can be preserved for almost a second, two or three orders of magnitude larger than has been measured in other materials.

The dramatic increase in demand for new capacity and higher performance has been a major issue in the design and deployment of contemporary wireless networks. The development of these capabilities is severely limited by the scarcity of two of the principal resources in wireless networks: energy and bandwidth. Emerging generations of wireless standards are addressing these issues through the use of technique such as cooperative communications and spectrum sharing. One focus of our recent work in wireless networks has addressed the fundamental limits of such techniques through the information theoretic analyses of relay and interference channels. A further issue that we are addressing is the fundamental ability of the physics of the radio channel to provide security in data transmission, and the development of codes and other methods to exploit this capability. In the area of social networks, our focus has been on two areas of interest. The first is the development of new models and analytical techniques for studying the degrees of social separation in small-world networks, and the application of such models to aid in the understanding of social phenomena that have been observed in experimental studies of social networks. The second area of interest has been the development of an on-line content trading platform, and the use of this platform as an experimental test-bed to investigate the behavior of users in various types of content sharing and content trading scenarios. Smart grid has emerged as a key technology for improving the efficiency, efficacy and security of the distribution and consumption of electric power, and particularly for the integration of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, into the electricity grid.

My graduate students and I are working on several exciting and innovative research projects, which benefit from close collaborations with government and industrial research laboratories. A few examples of these projects fare given below: Physical (Optical) Layer Network Security:  Security in fiber optic networks is becoming of critical importance due to the nature and volume of the data that is transported. The optical layer of a network is itself vulnerable to attack by eavesdropping or jamming. My group is investigating several approaches using optical signal processing to counter these attacks, including optical steganography, all-optical encryption devices, anti-jamming techniques, and survivable network architectures. Optical Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA): Incoherent optical CDMA networks can offer several important system advantages that cannot be achieved with other multiplexing techniques such as TDM and WDM, including asynchronous access, soft blocking, privacy, scalability and variable quality of service. We are developing novel integrated technologies that will enable the realization of practical optical CDMA networks, which will be strong candidates for future broadband access networks. Nonlinear Optical Signal Processing for Ultrafast Networks:  Based on nonlinear phenomena in semiconductor devices and nonlinear fibers, numerous optical signal processing functions can be achieved which can enhance the performance of ultrafast optical networks. We are studying novel devices and their applications, including optical thresholding, auto-correlation peak extraction, demultiplexing, physical layer security enhancement, and interferometric noise suppression Optical Cancellation of RF Interference: Wireless communictions systems often suffer from co-site interference, where the signal from a nearby transmission antenna interferes with simultaneously receiving a weak signal in a nearby frequency band. Multipath effects make this problem especially challenging. We are investigating optical and optoelectronic signal processing techniques to process RF signals from single antennas as well as phased arrays, enhancing their performance and enabling rapid reconfigurability. The Photonic Neuron:  Using nonlinear optical and photonic materials, we have recently built a hybrid analog/digital signal processing device which performs all the functions of a physiological neuron, but one billion times fast. Our spiking neuron is faster and more efficient than a digital computer, and does not suffer from the noise accumulation of analog electronics. Using the photonic neuron, we are implementing sophisticated, ultrafast signal processing circuits and systems which emulate visual, auditory, and motor functions found in biological organisms. With a high degree of interaction between government and industrial research laboratories, the Lightwave Communications Laboratory offers students an opportunity to be involved in the creation of technology for the next generation of optical signal processing, computing and communications systems.

My recent research on function Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) analysis has centered on developing efficient algorithms for extracting information from large fMRI data sets. For example, in collaboration with neuroscience colleagues, we have developed algorithms for functionally aligning the cortices of multiple subjects using the fMRI data measured during movie viewing. To do so, we used have used two distinct alignment metrics: the correlation of corresponding time series and a metric based on aligning intra-subject functional connectivity. In other recent work we have examined the problem of spatially informed voxel selection from fMRI data, using methods based on spatially regularized boosting and level-set estimation. In ongoing work we are examining the issue of tracking the presence of people in a movie stimulus over time, based on fMRI data collected during the viewing of the stimulus.  My research group is also currently investigating problems of signal representation using trees and wavelet constructions, semi-supervised clustering of data, learning patterns in data, manifold regularization and estimation, and online learning.

The capability to synthesize, control and manipulate such a large portion of the spectrum (DC-THz) and possibly even optical frequencies in a single versatile platform, has tremendous opportunities in creating cutting-edge technology for a wide range of novel applications from ultra-fast wireless communication to biosensing, imaging, spectroscopy, medical diagnostics and beyond.

Of particular interest are the many-body phenomena observed in these low-dimensional structures at low temperatures and high magnetic fields. Our research includes the fabrication, via molecular-beam epitaxy followed by various lithography techniques, of very clean (low-disorder) quantum-confined carrier systems, as well as measurements of their electronic transport properties. The systems we are studying, namely novel, high-quality, quasi-two-dimensional electron and hole systems in selectively doped GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunction structures, are among the cleanest carrier systems available. In these structures, the mobile carriers are spatially separated from the dopant (impurity) atoms to minimize scattering. As a result, the mean-free-path of carriers at low temperatures reaches several microns, allowing us to study ballistic and phase-coherent transport. Such structures also provide a crucial and important test bed for new many-body physics, since the dominant interaction at low temperatures is the repulsion between the electrons themselves.

The continual scaling of VLSI devices to smaller dimensions, higher performance, and higher integration levels over the last thirty years has directly enabled the "information society." Scaling has reduced the cost of intelligence (that is, electronic circuits) by some six orders of magnitude, while performance has continuously increased. Continued growth of the information economy depends on the further scaling of silicon-based electronic devices to the 0.1 micron (nanoscale) level and beyond. Our group works to achieve this goal through the science and technology of silicon-based heterojunctions and three-dimensional integration for VLSI. The work involves the growth of novel materials on a near-atomic scale, materials processing, and finally their application into electronic devices such as heterojunction transistors, FET's, quantum devices, and also optoelectronic devices such as infrared detectors and emitters. Specific focuses in our lab include rapid thermal chemical vapor deposition, silicon-germanium and silicon-germanium-carbon alloys, silicon-on-insulator, and heterojunction devices.  On the other extreme, many electronic information processing systems as a whole are limited on both a fundamental and practical economic level by the human-machine interface. For example, the ability to deliver high-quality video is often limited by the display. In this area it is generally desirable to make products big (for example, the display), as opposed to making them small, as in traditional microelectronics; hence the label "macroelectronics" has emerged. Because low cost over a large area is a requirement for widespread impact in the future in this field, materials and technologies very different from VLSI are necessary. For example, polycrystalline and amorphous materials, instead of single crystals, and low-cost alternatives to conventional photolithography and etching are highly desirable. To this end, our lab focuses on organic and polymeric semiconductors because of their ease of deposition over large areas (and applications to organic LED's and FET's) as well as on amorphous and polycrystalline silicon for TFT's. Coupled with these materials are efforts to pattern them and fabricate devices using large-area printing technologies such as ink-jet printing, as well as work to fabricate systems such as flat panel displays on unconventional flexible and lightweight substrates.

With the recent progress in micro and nano-fabrication capabilities however, the field saw the introduction of increasingly more complex quantum emitters as well as photonic components. While this provided an unprecedented degree of control over the precise way matter degrees of freedom interact with the omnipresent electromagnetic degrees of freedom, it also lead to formidable theoretical challenges in the description of the systems at hand.

As a result, their application space has also expanded, from isolated server rooms to desktops to personal-area swarms to within the body. The pace has brought ICs to a point where they now face fundamental limits of energy, density, and performance. As a result, modern IC design requires new methods of scaling. Fortunately, since ICs have expanded into such a broad range of applications, there are many new opportunities to push their limits. These opportunities, however, are extremely diverse, requiring circuits that exploit the properties of new algorithms, new materials and devices, and new application characteristics.  Our research focuses on analog and digital integrated circuits. Our emphasis is on developing system platforms for emerging applications, especially where considerable computation and instrumentation is required but energy is severely constrained. Important examples include implantable and wearable biomedical systems and remote sensing and processing network nodes. To drive this, there are two broad thrusts to our research: (1) application driven circuits and algorithms for ultra-low-power systems, and (2) platform components for low-power processing and communication in advanced and emerging technologies.  By focusing on specific application domains, electronic systems can perform rich sensor acquisition and efficient algorithm computation. We aim to develop analog topologies to acquire diverse, multi-channel biomedical signals, and algorithm computation engines to extract specific correlations with physiological processes and conditions.  Low-power processing and communication are critical means to reduce system power. To make their broad utilization increasingly viable, we aim to develop logic, connectivity circuits, and memory circuits (e.g., SRAM) to overcome emerging limitations in advanced technologies (e.g., nanometer CMOS) and alternate technologies (e.g., thin-film large-area electronics).

Many interesting new applications will be enabled by trace-gas sensors that are fast, compact, field-deployable, sensitive, and selective. Laser-based spectroscopic sensor systems have an excellent potential to address all those needs and provide noninvasive, rapid chemical analysis of the sample of interest both remotely or in-situ. The main research areas explored by my group are:  Development of new optical instrumentation, spectroscopic measurement methods, and data-analysis techniques Implementation of novel laser sources such as quantum cascade lasers or interband cascade lasers Investigation of new applications in interdisciplinary research areas Exploration of modern photonics technologies, materials, and devices Efficient transfer of novel technologies and fundamental science discoveries to applications The development of laser spectroscopic techniques strongly relies on increasing the availability of new laser sources. Therefore, one of my research directions is focused on development of widely tunable mid-infrared external cavity quantum cascade lasers (EC-QCLs) for high-resolution spectroscopic applications in chemical analysis. This technology enables new applications that represent a significant challenge for spectroscopists with existing laser sources (i.e., detection of complex molecules with broadband unresolved ro-vibrational absorption bands, simultaneous detection of multiple molecular species, and spectroscopy of liquid/solid samples). EC-QCLs with tuning ranges up to 15% of the center wavelength and output powers up to 50mW were recently demonstrated in various spectroscopic applications, such as photoacoustic detection of broadband absorbers and high-resolution (< 0.001 cm-1) Faraday rotation spectroscopy of nitric oxide. In the case of single-sampling-point trace-gas monitoring, lack of spatial information makes it impossible to localize specific emission sources (e.g., accidental gas leaks or unauthorized industrial emissions). The deployment of a sensor network will enable continuous spatial trace-gas monitoring of a large geographical area, providing complete static (concentration) and dynamic (fluxes, sources, and sinks) information about target analytes. In one of our current research projects we are developing a low-power, miniature spectroscopic trace-gas sensor for wirelessly communicating distributed sensor networks. Off particular interest in this research effort are ultra-sensitive spectroscopic techniques, application of novel optoelectronic devices, power-efficient electronics for data acquisition and signal processing, and integration at both the device and the system level.

Actin is a 43 kilo-dalton protein that has been highly conserved since the dawn of the eukaryotes over a billion years ago. Primordial precursor forms of actin and tubulin exist in bacteria, pointing to an even earlier origin for polymerizing proteins as generators of movement. Its emergence at the same time as the eukaryotic cell membrane, replacing the rigid cell walls of prokaryotes, enabled cells to exhibit a wide variety of dynamic shape variation at the cell edge. These movements are the structural basis for cell migration, tension generation, engulfment of other organisms, muscle contraction, and various modes of nutrient transport. Perhaps the most dynamic manifestation of the versatility of the actin microfilament system is the human nervous system, where cycles of polymerization and depolymerization of actin are an essential element of neural plastic ity.  Schutt's laboratory has used x-ray crystallography, selected-site mutagenesis, and other biophysical techniques to reveal the structures and roles of actin-binding proteins. This large family of proteins, including profilin, gelsolin, actin depolymerization protein, tropomyosin, and myosin, controls the dynamic organization of the actin microfilament system. Recently, Schutt has become interested in the structural biology of human neuro-developmental disorders, such as autism, where genomic variation in genes for key actin-binding proteins are well-correlated with dysfunctional synaptic connections. The architectonic challenge of bridging human behavior to molecular changes in the human brain must involve a full realization of the potential of the actin microfilament system to continuously reorganize into functional structures at cell edge and inwards towards the cell nucleus.

In short, we aim to develop new chemical procedures to join together, at the molecular level, dissimilar materials that, once assembled, form the basis of novel devices. As chemists, we think of systems on the molecular level; this provides us with a perspective that is different from that of engineers or biologists, two groups with whom we collaborate extensively. Because we do operate on the “molecular level,“ we can often propose solutions to scientific problems that are not on the “radar screen” of these colleagues.  Most of our work is based on self-assembled monolayers of organophosphonates, which we have nicknamed SAMPs.

In a natural setting, however, bacteria co-exist in astounding numbers and compete for limited resources.  The discovery of staggering bacterial diversity in various habitats, such as soil or the human gut, and the impact of these communities on the environment or the host have highlighted the need to understand bacterial intra- and interspecies interactions.

Such an ensemble-averaged description becomes inadequate, however, as the number of molecules under consideration decreases where the observable range of fluctuation approximately scales with N-1/2. To an observer in the macroscopic world, the changes in the microscopic states as a function of time and location are no longer deterministic but probabilistic. The central premise of the current research thrust is that these local stochastic fluctuations give rise to the chemical and physical transformations as they appear in the macroscopic world. This general problem is studied at the most fundamental, single-molecule and single-particle level. New experimental approaches are devised to enable real-time observations of individual molecules as they move and function. Theoretical frameworks are concurrently formulated to afford a quantitative understanding. Current research topics include: (1) High-resolution quantitative single-molecule protein dynamics, where we focus on large-amplitude conformational transitions in proteins and attempt to develop a predictive understanding of these molecular machines. (2) Real-time 3D single-particle tracking spectroscopy, where we are developing new techniques to follow the reactivity of a molecule-scale probe in real time and to directly correlate the chemical or physical processes with the 3D spatial location of the probe.

Here's an example: you're browsing DVDs in a video store. You pick one up—you like it, perhaps you might buy it, but you're not sure yet. You put it back down, and stroll down the aisle, pick a second DVD up. You compare them; perhaps today you decide to buy the first DVD. What happened in your brain as you went through all this? What are the neural mechanisms that allow you to remember, for a few seconds, how much you liked the first DVD; to compare the two DVDs; to make a decision; to apply the rules of behavior appropriate for the context you're in (here, a video store)? In other words, what are the neural mechanisms underlying your cognitive abilities?  What methods do we use in our research? We use a combination of computational, behavioral, and electrophysiological techniques. We train rats to perform tasks that require cognitive components that we're interested in studying. For example, we train them to remember a stimulus for a few seconds, and to then make a behavior based on their memory of the stimulus. We can then study neural responses during this behavior, and observe the neural correlates of short-term memory. To help us understand the mechanisms behind our findings, we build computational models of networks of spiking neurons, with which we explore the circuit architectures and mechanistic hypotheses that could explain the experimental results. The models both give us greater insight into potential mechanisms, and help us decide what are the best next experiments to test and distinguish between hypotheses.  Who are we? Personnel in the lab range from purely computational to purely experimental. We try to minimize the barriers in going from one end of this spectrum to the other: all researchers in the lab are encouraged to flow easily and freely within the computational/experimental spectrum, according to their own interests and needs at any given point in time, and to talk frequently with people at other points of the spectrum.

Vertebrates appear bilaterally symmetric, but have internal asymmetries along the LR axis. This axis is revealed by the asymmetric placement of organs along the midline. For example, the human heart is located on the left of the body cavity, while the liver is located on the right. While genes implicated in LR patterning have been identified, we do not know how the LR axis is established, how the axis is aligned with the existing dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior axes, or how LR information is received and interpreted by developing organs. Proper LR axis formation is critical for organogenesis as correct organ placement allows for proper connectivity with the developing vasculature. In humans, defects in LR patterning often manifest as congenital heart disease. Our current studies focus on a pathway known to be involved in left-right patterning, and on identifying new genes involved in this process.  	TRUE

Most alpha-herpesviruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus HSV; varicella-zoster virus, VZV; and pseudorabies virus, PRV) are parasites of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) in their natural hosts. This life style is remarkable because of all the neurotropic viruses that also enter the PNS (e.g., rabies), only the alpha-herpesviruses routinely STOP in the PNS of their natural hosts and establish a reactivatable, latent infection. Normally, this PNS infection is relatively benign, promoting survival of both virus and host. However, aberrations in this pathway give rise to the set of common diseases caused by these viruses. For example, invasion of the CNS is a rare, but exceedingly serious possibility. The directional spread of a herpes infection from epithelial surfaces to PNS neurons (where latency is established), and then, upon reactivation, spread back to epithelial surfaces constitutes the virus survival strategy. Research in my laboratory is directed toward answering several basic questions: What are the virus- and cell-encoded mechanisms that direct virus into and back out of the PNS? Why does the virus only occasionally enter the CNS in its natural host? What are the molecular roadblocks that make CNS infection rare in the natural host and frequent in the non-natural host? What are the viral gene products that promote disease and how do they work? How do the PNS and CNS respond to viral infection? These basic questions continue to lead us into exciting (and sometimes unexpected) areas. Two major areas of work are outlined below.  	TRUE

Fertilization, the fusion of two haploid gametes to create a diploid zygote, is the basis of sexual reproduction, without which none of us would be here. However, cell fusion is not limited to fertilization, but plays important roles during vertebrate development and disease. For example, becoming competence to fuse is part of the differentiation pathway of cells destined to become muscle fibers. For both yeast and vertebrate cells, differentiating cells exit the cell cycle and acquire new functions. The coordination of differentiation and cell division is of vital importance; one hallmark of cancer is the loss of differentiated functions with the renewed capacity for proliferation. Similarly, when yeast cells mate, they must carefully coordinate the transition from the mitotic pathway into the mating pathway. Indeed, many of the proteins required for mating have other essential functions in mitosis, and cells must prevent their premature co-option into the mating pathway. Because several genes required for yeast conjugation have close homologs in all eukaryotic organisms, it is likely that the rules governing the transition from mitosis to mating will be generally applicable. We are exploring these questions by analyzing two of the major steps in yeast mating; cell fusion and nuclear envelope fusion.  	TRUE

All eukaryotic cells contain a profusion of membrane-bounded compartments. Traffic among these compartments is brisk. Cargo is transported in membrane vesicles that bud from one compartment, travel through the cell, and deliver their contents by fusing with another compartment. Underlying this intricate choreography is a set of proteins and protein complexes responsible for the creation, movement, docking, and fusion of vesicles. Our lab seeks to understand the design principles that endow these protein nanomachines with the ability to manipulate membrane vesicles, thereby powering a bustling intracellular transportation network. A second major focus within our group is bacteria, and the remarkable finding that these single-celled organisms communicate with one another by emitting and receiving small-molecule signals. We are interested in cataloging the signal molecules and in understanding their biosynthesis and detection. Moreover, since bacteria often respond to these signals in undesirable ways – like forming antibiotic-resistant biofilms or mounting an attack on a human host – we are interested in discovering and characterizing molecules that interfere with bacterial communication. We are investigating these issues using a range of biochemical and biophysical approaches. For example, we are attempting to determine the crystal structures of the enzymes responsible for synthesizing the signal molecules, and of the receptors responsible for detecting them. We have also begun to identify antagonists – molecules that inhibit signaling – and we are interested in using biochemical and structural methods to figure out how they work and how they might be improved by rational design. Finally, in collaboration with other Princeton labs in the molecular biology, chemistry, and physics departments, we are trying to understand how bacteria integrate the information they receive via multiple different signal molecules to craft an appropriate response.

Intracellular response to dsRNA  Double-stranded RNA or dsRNA is a major regulator of gene expression in all mammalian cells. A number of membrane-tethered, cytosolic and nuclear proteins serve as receptors that recognize dsRNA and control dsRNA response. Often, dsRNA response is linked to the production of interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines and control of innate and adaptive immunity.  Broader roles of these programs in homeostasis, cell cycle, differentiation, senescence and aging are also emerging.

We also aim to identify and characterize areas of the genome that serve to regulate chromosomal functions, including transcription, DNA replication and repair, recombination, and chromosome segregation.  To address these questions, we use three biological systems: (1) S. cerevisiae to address basic molecular mechanisms; (2) C. elegans to test the importance of those mechanisms in a simple multicellular organism and to serve as a "stepping stone" to bridge yeast and human studies; and (3) cell lines and clinical samples to directly interrogate relevance to human development and disease.

Over the past few decades and in spite of earlier achievements in controlling few major infections, the global effort is being undermined by emergence or re-emergence of new pathogens, development of resistance in microbes and their vectors and the added threat of intentional use of microorganisms to cause harm. The global community is less than prepared to address these challenges. For example, the ability to detect and assess these threats is modest and tools for responding by antimicrobials, vaccines or environmental adjustments are not keeping pace with the expanded threats. The problems are compounded by absence of political will at global or national levels.  My research focus is on two areas related to global infection. First is a detailed examination of causes of emergence and re-emergence of microorganisms. These include evolution of human-microbe relationship, environmental and genetic influences and the role of selective pressures e.g. antimicrobials on development of resistance in the causative organisms or their insect vectors. Several strategies for controlling infectious disease at the national level, are being examined, including chemotherapy, vaccines and community containment. As an extension of this area, I became involved in examining the intersection of life sciences and national and global security. Dual use technology raises multiple concerns. The challenge is to maintain the culture of science openness and free communication balanced with responsibility and awareness.  The second major area of investigations involves discovery, development and global deployment and use of vaccines. Among infectious diseases control measures, vaccines have proven most effective and cost saving. Over the past decade, I have led the effort to develop and launch four new vaccines. These include vaccines for infection with rotavirus, human papillomavirus, shingles and combination of measles, mumps, rubella and varicella. While these and other previously developed vaccines should have an impressive impact on the global burden of illness from infectious disease, the reach of vaccines and their central role in controlling infection is inadequate. A detailed examination of the global gap in vaccination is being conducted as well as strategies for expanding their beneficial role at public health and policy levels.	TRUE

Sensory processing plays a role not only in detecting and responding to species-specific songs, but also in generating these dynamic acoustic signals.	TRUE

These features are essential for life and organized by the microtubule cytoskeleton, which resembles the skeletal system that supports our human body. Each cell type and shape requires a specific microtubule architecture. For instance, long and bundled microtubules make up the axonal extensions of a nerve cell that can reach up to 1 meter in length, whereas a spherical microtubule network renders a lymphocyte perfectly round. In contrast to the human skeleton, the microtubule cytoskeleton is also highly dynamic. Most cells regularly undergo cell division, during which the cell-type specific interphase microtubule network is completely disassembled and replaced by short and dynamic microtubules of the mitotic spindle to capture, align and then segregate chromosomes.

Against a constant background of established infections, epidemics of new and old infectious diseases periodically emerge, greatly magnifying the global burden of infections. Many pathogens causing disease in humans exhibit nearly unique human tropism, posing additional challenges for studying host-pathogen interaction and for efficiently testing anti-microbial intervention strategies. Humanized mice, i.e. mice expressing human genes or containing human tissues, have emerged as powerful systems to model human infections in vivo. We have and continue to construct humanized hosts genetically or via xenotransplantation to analyze previously intractable human (hepatotropic) pathogens. These systems offer unprecedented opportunities to effectively study host-pathogen interactions in vivo and to preclinically evaluate drug and vaccine candidates.  The research of my lab focuses on immune responses and pathogenesis to human pathogens infecting the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) and C viruses (HCV), yellow fever and Dengue viruses and plasmodial parasites. My group combines tissue engineering, molecular virology/pathogenesis, and animal construction, to create and apply innovative technologies for the study and intervention of human hepatotropic infections.

Fertilization, the fusion of two haploid gametes to create a diploid zygote, is the basis of sexual reproduction, without which none of us would be here. However, cell fusion is not limited to fertilization, but plays important roles during vertebrate development and disease. For example, becoming competence to fuse is part of the differentiation pathway of cells destined to become muscle fibers. For both yeast and vertebrate cells, differentiating cells exit the cell cycle and acquire new functions. The coordination of differentiation and cell division is of vital importance; one hallmark of cancer is the loss of differentiated functions with the renewed capacity for proliferation. Similarly, when yeast cells mate, they must carefully coordinate the transition from the mitotic pathway into the mating pathway. Indeed, many of the proteins required for mating have other essential functions in mitosis, and cells must prevent their premature co-option into the mating pathway. Because several genes required for yeast conjugation have close homologs in all eukaryotic organisms, it is likely that the rules governing the transition from mitosis to mating will be generally applicable. We are exploring these questions by analyzing two of the major steps in yeast mating; cell fusion and nuclear envelope fusion.  	TRUE

If we consider lipid bilayers themselves as compartments, then Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, have four distinct subcellular locations: the cytoplasm, inner membrane (IM), periplasm, and outer membrane (OM). The noncytoplasmic compartments are collectively termed the cell envelope. We wish to understand cellular assembly, in particular, the process of OM biogenesis. The OM is an asymmetric lipid bilayer containing phospholipids in the inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer leaflet. Membrane spanning outer membrane proteins (OMPs) typically assume a beta-barrel conformation. All OM components are synthesized in the cytoplasm or the IM and therefore, OM biogenesis requires the transport of these molecules across the cell envelope for assembly at their final cellular location. Strikingly, these transport and assembly processes occur in an environment that lacks an obvious energy source such as ATP. We have used a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and bioinformatics to identify the cellular machinery required for the assembly of OMPs and LPS in the OM. lpsBoth of these assembly machineries have protein components in every cellular compartment, and this spatial organization suggests the temporal order of component function (Figure 1). Current effort in the lab is directed towards understanding the how these machines function in molecular terms, and how their activities are coordinated.	TRUE

His current research focuses on social, political and ethical issues raised by human stem cell research, cloning, advanced reproductive technologies, genetic testing, genetic selection, and genetic engineering. His previous book for a popular audience, Remaking Eden, demystifies the science and technology of genetics and reproduction, and describes incredible new ways in which people will be able to reproduce and choose the genes they provide to their children. His current book project explores the basis for widespread public concerns over all aspects of biotechnology. Dr. Silver argues that much of the general opposition is based not on a rational evaluation of risks and benefits, but rather on a covert or unconscious fear that biotechnology, by its very nature, infringes upon the soul or spirit of human beings or the soul or spirit of other organisms and systems of life. In the context of certain belief systems, Dr. Silver claims that fears of soul infringement are valid.

The activities of approximately a third of the proteins in vertebrate cells are regulated by reversible phosphorylation at serine and threonine resides. There are almost a thousand different protein kinases, each of which catalyzes the transfer of phosphoryl groups from ATP to a specific set of protein substrates in response to a regulatory input. In contrast, there are just a few phosphoprotein phosphatases to catalyze the removal of these groups. Our research over the past several years has focused on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of these phosphatases. Through these efforts we have identified potential pharmaceutical targets for the global regulation of phosphatase activity, developed screens for useful therapeutic agents, and characterized pharmaceutical leads that provide a basis for further medicinal chemistry exploration.

Signaling occurs through networks of proteins and nucleic acids, culminating in changes of gene expression and so changes in the proteome of the cell. We are focused on the architecture of these intracellular networks. What is the relation between network architecture and function? For example, can we understand the selection of architectures in terms of general information-processing concepts such as signal to noise, memory, and adaptation? Even in a single bacterium such as E. coli, there are hundreds of coexisting networks. Our belief is that a deep study of a small number of "model" networks will yield general tools to analyze information processing by cell. It is important to choose these model networks carefully. The network components should be well characterized and the physiological function of the network should be known and subject to quantitative measurement. Probes of the internal dynamics of the network such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) or direct imaging of dynamic spatial structure, will be critical in developing and testing quantitative models. It will also be important to choose networks which complement each other well, spanning a broad range of architectures and functions. A preliminary list includes (i) quorum sensing, in which the cell slowly integrates signals from its neighbors to commit to a developmental decision such as invasion of a host, (ii) chemotaxis, which requires adaptation and rapid response to changing chemical concentrations, (iii) cell-division networks, where accuracy and checkpoints are essential, and (iv) metabolic networks which tie together diverse inputs to maintain homeostasis.

A major goal is to understand how telomeres, the physical ends of chromosomes, contribute to chromosome stability. Yeast chromosomes end in ~350 bps of C1-3A/TG1-3 DNA and the many proteins that associate with this DNA. Telomeres are essential for the stable maintenance of yeast chromosomes (Sandell and Zakian, 1993): they protect the end of the chromosome against degradation, help the cell distinguish intact from broken DNA, and promote replication of the very end of the chromosome. In addition, yeast telomeres are specialized sites for gene expression: genes placed near yeast telomeres are transcriptionally repressed, a phenomenon called telomere position effect (TPE) (Gottschling et al., 1990). In most eukaryotes, telomeric DNA is synthesized by a telomere specific reverse transcriptase called telomerase, but recombination provides an alternative mechanism for lengthening telomeric tracts in both yeast (Teng et al., 2000) and mammals.
